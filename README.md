Next.js is a powerful framework built on top of React that enables developers to create fast, highly optimized web applications with minimal configuration. Itâ€™s particularly known for its server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities, which improve SEO, loading speeds, and overall user experience.

Next.js also simplifies the development process by providing built-in routing, image optimization, API routes, and automatic code-splitting. Compared to standard React, Next.js reduces the need for boilerplate code and configuration, making it easier to build scalable applications. Additionally, with its hybrid rendering approach, developers can choose between SSR, SSG, or client-side rendering (CSR) on a per-page basis, allowing for more flexibility in performance optimization.

Overall, Next.js is widely used by developers who want to build fast, SEO-friendly applications and benefit from both a powerful feature set and a robust developer experience.
